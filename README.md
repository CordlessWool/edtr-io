## Committed to Simplicity and Openness

Edtr.io is backed by Open Education heavyweights: serlo.org and the HPI Schul-Cloud, and supported by Splish.

It has been born from the needs of the learning platform serlo.org and builds on the original work of Serlo’s co-founder und CTO [Aeneas Rekkas](https://github.com/aeneasr). Serlo.org is inspired by Wikipedia and already provides thousands of articles, videos and exercises for one million German students every month. Serlo.org is growing steadily. In 2018, the platform went international.

Great content editing is essential for the user experience of a community-driven site. That's why serlo.org and the HPI Schul-Cloud decided to develop a new editor from scratch - edtr.io was started to make editing on the web easy for students and teachers.

Splish was founded in 2017 by the very people working on the editor, to be able to provide commercial support.

Currently, edtr.io It is being developed intensely, to be ready for the launch of the German Schul-Cloud, started by the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) in cooperation with MINT-EC, and funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. The HPI Schul-Cloud aims to provide low-threshold access to digital educational content to schools nationwide.

We love education. We need this editor. We're in for the long haul.

### Core Characteristics

Edtr.io is a user-friendly, flexible and extensible WYSIWYG in-line web editor.

An in-line editor provides an easy way to work on web content without having to leave the context. Content creators work directly on elements, adding or changing them in-place. As a visual editor, Edtr.io does not require the knowledge of markup languages, programming experience or special training.

The edtr.io project provides a lean core of basic editing functionalities.

Plugins cover options from simple text formatting to entire blocks of interactive exercises, providing the rich possibilities needed for education. Or the options needed for virtually any CMS.

Due to the plugin architecture, platform providers have full control over the available features. Put together the plugins you need to cover your use case, or write your own.

Content created with edtr.io is responsive, ready for the desktop as well as mobile.

### Technicalities

Edtr.io is based on reusable React components. Slate.js is used for the core Richt Text editing functionalities. The state is a normalized JSON object; no HTML is involved. If you came because you are tired of the limitations of contenteditable, you are in the right place.
